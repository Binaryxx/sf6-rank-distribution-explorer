# sf6_rank_distribution_explorer  
  
The repository contains the Jupyter Notebook which webscrapes the official Street Fighter 6 website to collect the necessary information to visualize the player base distribution across ranks.   
The repository also contains a pdf file of a slide presentation that provides a detailed overview of the project, including details about the purpose, function, and process walkthrough.  

The only missing component for the code to work would be a separate .txt file that has the login credentials for a CAPCOM account, with the email in the first line and the password in the second line. The file path will also need to be updated to refer to the file.
